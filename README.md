# SpamDetection
Hi , this is the project I made for my seminar at Afeka.

I trained a model that can detect spam messages and combined this project to my Gmail box in the GCP dashboard.
The main.py runs through my first 100 messages and filters the spam messages , and moves them to another label.

This project is meant to be a POC but has alot of potential to become an actual tool!
